## Byte-adder
This repository contains Python source code for a simple byte adder. The adder is designed to take two 8-bit binary numbers as input and produce their sum as output. The code uses a combination of bit manipulation and bitwise operators to implement the addition operation.

The Python code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great reference for anyone learning about digital circuits or low-level programming concepts. The code is organized into functions that handle different parts of the byte addition process, such as carry propagation and bit addition.

In addition to the Python code, this repository also includes test scripts and sample input/output files to help verify the correctness of the byte adder. The test scripts generate random 8-bit numbers and verify that the output of the byte adder matches the expected result.

Feel free to use this code as a reference for your own programming projects involving digital circuits or bitwise operations.
